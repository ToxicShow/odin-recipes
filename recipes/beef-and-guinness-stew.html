   <h1>Beef and gunness stew</h1> 
   <h2>About the recipe</h2>
   <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <l1>Bacon: This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.</l1>
       <l2>Beef: Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.</l2>
       <l3>Seasonings and herbs: This flavorful beef stew is seasoned with salt, black pepper, fresh garlic, white sugar, and fresh thyme.</l3>
       <l4>Beer: Of course, you'll need a can of dark beer (such as Guinness).</l4>
       <l5> Vegetables: This chunky Guinness stew features onions, carrots, and celery.</l5>
       <l6>Tomato paste: Tomato paste adds richness and flavor depth.</l6>
       <l7> Stock: Use store-bought or homemade broth. You can use chicken or beef stock.</l7>
       <l8>Â· Mashed potatoes: Mashed potatoes are optional, but they make a great bed for the Guinness stew. Try our top-rated Basic Mashed Potatoes recipe.</l8>
   </ul>
