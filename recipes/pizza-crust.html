   <h2>About the recipe</h2>
   <p>This pizza crust recipe was given to me by a friend. It is quick, easy, and delicious!</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <l1>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</l1>
       <l2>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</l2>
       <l3>2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</l3>
       <l4>2 tablespoons olive oil</l4>
       <l5>2 teaspoons white sugar</l5>
       <l6>1 teaspoon salt</l6>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <l1>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</l1>
       <l2>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</l2>
       <l3>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</l3>
       <l4>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings.</l4>
       <l5>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</l5>
